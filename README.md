# King County Population Density Mapping  

This project visualizes the population distribution of King County using **ArcGIS Pro**.  
It applies:  
- Isarithmic mapping with triangulation (TIN)  
- Dot mapping (graduated & proportional symbols)  
- Comparison of 2D and 3D density visualization  

**Main Focus:** Evaluate the advantages and limitations of isarithmic vs. dot mapping for population density analysis.
