# King County Population Density Mapping

This project visualizes the population distribution of King County using ArcGIS Pro.

## Techniques Used
- **Isarithmic Mapping (TIN):** Triangulation to create a smooth population density surface.
- **Dot Mapping:** Using graduated and proportional symbols to represent population density.
- **2D & 3D Visualization:** Comparing 2D and 3D renderings for better interpretation.

## Main Focus
The project evaluates the advantages and limitations of isarithmic vs. dot mapping for effectively representing population density.

## Repository Files
- `Lab_4-1.pdf` → Lab report with methodology, answers to lab questions, and discussion of results.  
- `Layout1-2.jpg` → Map layout visualizing population density distribution in King County.

## Summary
- Generated conceptual centroid points from dasymetric areas.  
- Built a Triangular Irregular Network (TIN) to visualize population density in 2D and 3D.  
- Compared results with dot symbolization methods (graduated and proportional).  
- Critically evaluated the effectiveness of each visualization technique for spatial analysis.
